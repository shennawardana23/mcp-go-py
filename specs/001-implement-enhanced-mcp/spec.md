## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

- All requirements are clear and unambiguous
- No implementation details included
- Focus on user value and business outcomes

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As an AI developer, I want to use the enhanced MCP-PBA-TUNNEL system to access advanced AI development capabilities including intelligent memory management, comprehensive tool ecosystems, and sophisticated reasoning chains, so that I can build more powerful and context-aware AI applications with production-ready security and performance.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am developing an AI application with complex context requirements, **When** I interact with the MCP-PBA-TUNNEL system, **Then** I receive intelligent memory management that maintains conversation context and relationships between different pieces of information across sessions.

2. **Given** I need to analyze codebases and web content for my AI application, **When** I use the MCP-PBA-TUNNEL tool ecosystem, **Then** I can securely access web scraping, code analysis, and data processing capabilities without worrying about security vulnerabilities or performance issues.

3. **Given** I am building a complex reasoning system for my AI application, **When** I engage the MCP-PBA-TUNNEL reasoning capabilities, **Then** I receive multi-step reasoning chains that maintain context and provide systematic problem-solving approaches.

4. **Given** I am deploying an AI application to production, **When** I use the MCP-PBA-TUNNEL system, **Then** all interactions are secure, performant, and maintain data integrity without requiring additional security hardening.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when memory context becomes very large and needs efficient retrieval?
- How does the system handle concurrent users accessing the same tools?
- What occurs when tool execution encounters network failures or timeouts?
- How does the system behave when reasoning chains encounter contradictory information?
- What happens during system maintenance windows or partial outages?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide intelligent memory management that creates and maintains relationships between different pieces of context information across user sessions
- **FR-002**: System MUST offer a comprehensive tool ecosystem including web scraping, code analysis, terminal execution, and database analysis capabilities
- **FR-003**: System MUST support advanced reasoning chains that can process multi-step logic while maintaining context and providing systematic problem-solving
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure all tool executions are secure with input validation, sandboxing, and appropriate access controls
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain consistent user experience across all MCP protocol interfaces with standardized response formats and error handling
- **FR-006**: System MUST optimize performance for memory queries (under 100ms response time) and tool executions (under 5-second timeouts)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide comprehensive logging and monitoring for all enhanced capabilities to support debugging and performance analysis
- **FR-008**: System MUST support concurrent usage patterns where multiple users can access enhanced capabilities simultaneously without interference

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Memory Context**: Represents a piece of information with relationships to other contexts, importance scoring, and metadata for efficient retrieval and organization
- **Tool Definition**: Defines available tools in the ecosystem including their capabilities, security requirements, and execution parameters
- **Reasoning Chain**: Represents a multi-step logical process that maintains context and builds upon previous reasoning steps
- **User Session**: Tracks user interactions across time with associated memory contexts and tool usage patterns
- **Security Policy**: Defines access controls, validation rules, and hardening requirements for tool executions and data access
